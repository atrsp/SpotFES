# SpotFES
##### Inspired by "Spotify", we created our own version of it, which works in the Linux terminal.
##### - Description: through two csv files containing multiple artists and songs (database), this program allows you to search for musics, create and edit playlists, listen to a song of your preference and have song suggestions based on your playlists. 

> ### This program is not finished yet!
